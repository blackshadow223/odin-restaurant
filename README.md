# odin-restaurant
This is the 3rd project of the course *JavaScript* from the curriculum
[The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

The purpose of this project is to practice dynamic rendering of UI
through JavaScript using bundlers like webpack and relevant plugins.

I've done my best.

### Sources
I took most of the images from Wikipedia, except for the background image.
So the credit for images of food go to Wikipedia.
